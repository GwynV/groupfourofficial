		<h1 id="topic"><b>Roots of Filipino Character</b></h1>
		<br>
		<h3>1. The Family and Home Environment</h3>
		<p>It is the foundation of Filipino character. Childbearing practices, family relations, and family attitudes and orientation are the main components of the home environment.</p>
		<br><hr><br>	
		<h3>2. The Social Environment</h3>
		<p>The main components of the social environment are social structures and social systems such as interpersonal religious and community interaction.</p>
		<br><hr><br>
		<h3>3. Culture and Language</h3>
		<p>Aside from emphasizing interpersonal values, Filipino culture is also characterized by an openness to the outside which easily incorporates foreign elements without a basic consciousness of our cultural core. </p>
		<br><hr><br>
		<h3>4. History</h3>
		<p>We are the product of our colonial history, which is regarded by many as the culprit behind our lack of nationalism and our colonial mentality.</p>
		<br><hr><br>
		<h3>5. The Educational System</h3>
		<p>Aside from the problems inherent in the use of a foreign language in our educational system, the educational system leads to other problems for us as a people.</p>
		<br><hr><br>	
		<h3>6. Religion</h3>
		<p>Religion is the root of Filipino optimism and its capacity to accept life's hardships.</p>
		<br><hr><br>
		<h3>7. The Economic Environment</h3>
		<p>Many Filipino traits are rooted in the poverty and hard life that is the lot of most Filipinos.</p>
		<br><hr><br>
		<h3>8. The Political Environment</h3>
		<p>The Philippine political environment is characterized by a centralization of power.</p>
		<br><hr><br>
		<h3>9. Mass Media</h3>
		<p>Mass media reinforces our colonial mentality. Advertisements using Caucasian models and emphasizing a product's similarity with imported brands are part of our daily lives.</p>
		<br><hr><br>
		<h3>10. Leadership and Role Models</h3>
		<p>Filipinos look up to their leaders as role models. Political leaders are the main models, but all other leaders serve as role models as well. Thus, when our leaders violate the law or show themselves to be self-serving and driven by personal interest when there is lack of public accountability there is a negative impact on the Filipino.</p><br>
